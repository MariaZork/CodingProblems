# Description

Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

```
Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 300
grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.
```

# Solution

=== "Python3"

```python3
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:

        if not grid:
            return 0

        rows = len(grid)
        cols = len(grid[0])
        count = 0
        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(cols):
                if grid[i][j] == "1":
                    count += 1

                    self.dfs(grid, i, j)

        return count

    def dfs(self, grid, i, j):
        rows = len(grid)
        cols = len(grid[0])

        if i < 0 or j < 0 or i >= rows or j >= cols or grid[i][j] != "1":
            return

        grid[i][j] = "0"

        self.dfs(grid, i + 1, j)
        self.dfs(grid, i - 1, j)
        self.dfs(grid, i, j + 1)
        self.dfs(grid, i, j - 1)
```
